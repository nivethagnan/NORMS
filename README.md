# NORMS

## Introduction

The world is heavily revolving around modernized technology. Simplicity, functionality, and ease of access are key in being able to sell a product or service to a customer. Many current day systems and interfaces are outdated and lack certain requirements that can have a wider appeal to many customers. Therefore, we decided to structure our project to possess all the attributes necessary to be simplistic, functional, user-friendly, and efficient. This product is called NORMâ€™s car rental. While using our system, customers will find that it has never been easier to rent a luxury car. We designed our system to be very user friendly and informative. Customers will be able to find all the specifications for the vehicle, as well as have the ability to reserve a luxury car of their choice with ease. The system is designed to collect the information of both the client and the vehicle being rented. It will then store the information for future access.
